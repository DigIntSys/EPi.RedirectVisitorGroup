# RedirectBlock
Use RedirectBlock to redirect users to other pages based on Visitor Groups.
To use, create appropriate Visitor Groups, then create RedirectBlock blocks pointing to relevant pages to redirect to. Create a blank page with content area for the blocks and then insert created RedirectBlock blocks to this page. Configure when these blocks should be visible based on Visitor Groups. If during the runtime block is supposed to be rendered on the page, redirect will take place.
