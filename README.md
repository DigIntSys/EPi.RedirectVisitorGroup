# RedirectBlock
Use RedirectBlock to redirect users to other pages based on Visitor Groups.
To use, create appropriate Visitor Groups, then create RedirectBlock blocks pointing to relevant pages to redirect to. In order to RedirectBlock to work it should be inserted in a content area. Configure when these blocks should be visible based on Visitor Groups. If during runtime a block is supposed to be rendered on the page, redirect will take place.
